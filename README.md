# Welcome to The Hangman game by *TulaUnogi*!


## Introduction

The Hangman is a simple Python3 console game, that runs on a mock terminal deployed on Heroku.
The goal of the game is to guess the secret words one letter at the time before running out of chances.
The number of correct and incorrect answers does not only decide on success or failure of the User,
but also it determines their score level. 
The table of High Scores is available to the User in the Main Menu.

What makes this version of The Hangman stand out is that the game itself is wrapped around a little story 
with a slightly murderous twist.
Because of that I would recommend this game for Users over the age of 15.


## The User Experience

### User Goals:

As a User I would like:

    - To have fun and be challenged.
    - To have the rules of the game explained to me in a clear manner.
    - The game to offer a wide range of secret words from different categories.
    - To be able to choose the game category by myself.
    - To be informed, that in this game- just like in real life- I may die only once.
    - To be offered another round of the murderous game after winning if I would feel brave enough to try 
    earning the high scores.
    - To be able to see the table of the high scores.
    - To easily navigate through available game options and see a feedback on my inputs.

### Designer's Goals:

As a Designer I would like:

    - Users to meet their goals stated above.
    - Provide a functional and engaging game without errors.
