# Welcome to The Hangman game by TulaUnogi!

## Introduction

The Hangman is a simple Python3 console game, that runs on a mock terminal deployed on Heroku.
The goal of the game is to guess the secret words one letter at the time before running out of chances.
The number of correct and incorrect answers does not only decide on success or failure of the user,
but also it determines their score level. 
The table of High Scores is available to user in the Main Menu.

What makes this version of The Hangman stand out is that the game itself is wrapped around a little story 
with a slightly murderous twist.
Because of that I would recommend this game for users over the age of 15.
